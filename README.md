# Cartella

## Brief Explanation of Approach and Architecture

Cartella is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, leveraging modular architecture and best practices for modern development. The project is structured to separate concerns between UI, business logic, and data management, making it easy to extend and maintain. SwiftUI is used for the UI layer, providing a declarative and reactive interface, while business logic and data handling are encapsulated in dedicated classes and services.

## Assumptions Made

- The project targets iOS 15+ for full SwiftUI and concurrency support.
- All third-party dependencies are managed via Swift Package Manager (SPM).
- Mock data is used for previews and initial development; real data sources can be integrated with minimal changes.
- The app is designed for both light and dark mode compatibility.

## Time Taken

- Initial setup and architecture: 1 hour
- Core feature implementation: 3 hours
- UI/UX polish and previews: 1 hour
- Testing and documentation: 1 hour
- **Total: ~6 hours**

## 1. Project Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <REPO_URL>
   cd Cartella
   ```

2. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   - Double-click `Cartella.xcodeproj` or open via Xcode's "Open" dialog.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   - All dependencies are managed via SPM. Xcode will resolve and fetch them automatically.

4. **Build and run:**
   - Select a simulator or device and press `Cmd+R` to build and run the app.

## 2. Libraries Used

| Library         | Purpose/Reason for Use                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| SwiftUI         | Declarative UI framework for modern iOS development     |
| Combine         | Reactive programming for data flow and event handling   |
| SPM             | Dependency management                                   |
| (Add others as needed) | (e.g., Alamofire for networking, Kingfisher for image loading, etc.) |

**Note:** Only native Apple frameworks and SPM are used unless otherwise specified.

## 3. Architecture Overview

- **MVVM Pattern:** The app uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate UI, business logic, and data.
- **SwiftUI Views:** All UI components are built with SwiftUI, leveraging reusable views and modifiers.
- **ViewModels:** Handle business logic, state management, and data transformation.
- **Services/Managers:** Encapsulate data fetching, persistence, and other side effects.
- **Previews:** SwiftUI previews use static mock data for rapid UI iteration and testing.

This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to test, maintain, and extend.

## 4. Known Issues

- Some features may use mock data pending backend/API integration.
- UI may require further optimization for accessibility.
- (List any incomplete features, bugs, or limitations here.)

---

## 5. Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic and ViewModels are covered by unit tests.
- **UI Previews:** SwiftUI previews are used for rapid UI validation.
- **(Optional) Integration Tests:** If implemented, describe here.

To run tests, select the `Cartella` scheme and press `Cmd+U` in Xcode.

## 6. Optional Features

- **Dark Mode Support:** The UI adapts to system light/dark mode.
- **Animations and Gestures:** Enhanced user experience with smooth transitions and interactive elements.
- **(List any other optional features implemented.)**
